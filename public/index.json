CAL was designed using principles of three theoretical frameworks: Curriculum Research Framework (CRF), which proposes different phases in the creation of research-based curriculum; Constructionism, which presents a computationally-rich project-based methodology based on identifying powerful ideas from a learning domain; and Positive Technological Development, which intentionally integrates socio-emotional and ethical dimensions into curricular experiences. The pedagogical foundation of CAL involves the understanding of coding as a literacy, that is, putting developmentally-appropriate powerful ideas of computer science in conversation with those taught in language arts. The paper first describes CAL and then presents results from both a pilot study and a cluster randomized controlled trial that set to evaluate CAL's feasibility and impact on students’ learning outcomes. Our findings showed that the CAL curriculum was not only feasible to implement, but also effective for improving coding skills. However, CAL's impact on computational thinking is less clear given that in the cluster randomized controlled trial, both the control and the intervention groups improved equally on a measure of computational thinking.","tags":["Coding","Computational Thinking","Design-based research","Powerful Ideas","ScratchJr"],"title":"Coding as another language: Research-based curriculum for early childhood computer science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhanxia Yang","Marina Bers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687048280,"objectID":"d3ee8b3c634fd43e0e619ea6ecf2a221","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/yang-examining-2023/","publishdate":"2023-06-18T00:30:44.6071Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-examining-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Background and Context Historically, women have been underrepresented in computer science.

Even though mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs are two separate constructs, these constructs are likely related and coexisted as a system of beliefs. Constructs of mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs may be interdependent to further contribute to learning motivation, behavior, and outcomes. Only a few studies investigated both mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs together. Guided by previous research studies, this study examined associations of mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs with their predicting factors: motivational variables, the use of learning strategies, and learning outcomes in mathematics among college students. Additionally, I investigated how mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs both as implicit beliefs associated with each other. Finally, to further conceptualize interaction between these implicit beliefs, I examined the existence of profiles of students who are different in mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs.  Consistent results of predictions on motivational variables and self-reported performance revealed the maladaptive feature of a fixed mindset of intelligence; on the other hand, a growth mindset of intelligence failed to be a significant predictor of motivational indicators in general. Meanwhile, a few factors in epistemological beliefs showed weak and unstable predictions on some motivational variables. Even though two subpopulations were identified when examining profiles for mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs, the main distinction between the two subpopulations is from growth and fixed mindset of intelligence. Therefore, the different profiles of students who are different in mindset of intelligence and different in epistemological beliefs are not supported by this data. Discussions related to current findings such as different operationalizations of mindset of intelligence and measures of epistemological beliefs are provided. Implications for future research are also discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Examining college students’ epistemological beliefs and mindset of intelligence and their association with learning motivations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucy Barnard-Brak","Tara Stevens","Zhanxia Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687048280,"objectID":"4180142f0062d8d936ee2861a6719546","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/barnard-brak-predictors-2020/","publishdate":"2023-06-18T00:30:43.778687Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barnard-brak-predictors-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The current study examined 2 sets of variables associated with parents prematurely exiting early intervention services for their child.

The most well-known one is the one involving sensory register, short-term memory, and long-term memory as shown in the figure below.\nThe processes involving above procedures are called Executive Processes.\nThey are like commands to the learner’s brain. These processes were controlled by the learner, either consciously or unconsciously. Executive Processing determines what one chooses to put into long-term memory and how much one thinks about the stimuli Let’s now take a look of what each comopent of the processing means.\nSensory Register Our brain 🧠 receives tons of information from our five senses (or maybe more than just the five senses) at a time.\nLet’s first experiment together. Let’s think about a place you go very often, see if you can recall the setting of the evironment such as color, texture, sound, position, etc.\nFrom the experiement, we may find out that we are not able to tell some of them. It is interesting that we see, hear, and touch the setting everyday, but why we are not able to tell. This is because they have never been into our sensory register.\nTwo key concepts are related to sensory register.\nAttention: actively attending stimuli by choice It is important to note that attention is a limited resource. We constantly pay attention to various things. If a learner’s attention is not in the classroom, it must be at somewhere else. Perception: infomration registered in sesory register is perceptions. They are mental interpretation based on our knowledge, experience, mental state, motivation, and other factors. In other words, they may not necessarily be facts. Based on the concept of sesory register, it is important for us as educators to help students pay attention to the things they are learning.\nHow to gain attention in a classroom?\nUse cues teachers lower their voices. teachers form routines of certain clapping to ask students to respond with clapping. teachers flash the classroom light. Make emotional connection with material. Like the journalist would use “Senate Kills Mass Transit Proposal” Incorporate surprising elements (arouse students’ interest); I have demonstrated Mobius Strip in class as an example. Activate students’ relevant prior knowledge. Warn about material that will be on the test. “This will be on tomorrow’s test.” Research Evidence on some of the practices.\nArmony et al. (2007) Experimental tests revealed that both positive vocalizations, t(39) = 4.68, d = 0.74, p \u0026lt; .001, and negative vocalizations, t(39) = 4.76, d = 0.75, p \u0026lt; .001, were remembered better than neutral ones. Now, it’s time to reflect. Have you used or observed some of the practices to gain attention? What are they? Do they work well in your opinion?\nShort-Term Memory (Working Memory) After information registered in sesory register, some will get lost and others will pass onto Working Memory.\nAgain, let’s experiment it first by checking out this Youtube Video.\nHow did it go with the experiment? If you were like me, you probably missed several questions or even were not sure if certain items were there when they were asked. This is normal because our Working Memory has limitations.\nHow does Short-Term Memory (STM) work?\nholds conscious thoughts and information actively being used\nworks with new stimuli and information from long-term memory\nrehearsal: repeating infomation to keep it in working memory longer.\nLimited capacity.\nSTM can hold about 7 (plus or minus 2) bits of information at a time. Limited time for storage.\nusually can hold for seconds (e.g., 30 seconds). However, we should be aware of individual differences in working memory capacity. One of my students shared that she had imagery memory, after the given time in the video, she tried to draw all of them out (see her example here) and was able to answer correctly to the experiment in the video.\nKnowing Short-Term Memory, so what? Do you know that Dory lost STM and what happened to Dory? This is a disease called anterograde amnesia. Well, Dory’s case is not the point but it conveys the point. when you read a sentence, you keep the beginning of the sentence in your short-term memory until you reach the end, which is vital for understanding the full context of the sentence. Similarly, mental arithmetic requires us to keep numbers in our short-term memory as we manipulate them.\nKnowing the importance of STM, here are some educational implications:\nAllocate time for rehearsal during classroom lessons Organize material into familiar patterns for students; Avoid information overload Review background knowledge before presenting new info Teach strategies for making efficient use of working memory Now, it’s your turn to reflect strategies that you’ve used to help you store informaiton in STM.\nLong Term Memory Let’s explore it first. Recall a fun activity in your childhood and then share the memorable scenes. Or, recall a mnemonic that you’ve learned in school.

The results of this study represent findings from a sample of 15-year-olds across the United States (n = 4978). Three distinct latent classes were identified. One latent class demonstrated significantly lower scores on all motivational indicators examined than the other two latent classes, suggesting disengagement in this latent class. Students from the rest two non-disengaged latent classes were considered as engaged students. Results indicate that over-claiming has a significant negative relationship with student achievement in mathematics among the engaged students. The disengaged group appears to over-claim the least.

Findings Females with ASD had a higher mean age at death than males with ASD; consistent with the trend in the sex differences in the general population. The results of the current study also indicate that individuals with ASD were, in fact, less likely than the general population to have Alzheimer’s disease or a form of dementia. However, males with ASD were significantly more likely to have acquired Alzheimer’s disease or a form of dementia as compared to females with ASD.

Although several investigators have disseminated structured criteria and visual inspection aids or strategies, inconsistencies in interpreting graphed data continue to exist even for individuals considered to be experts at interpreting SCED graphs. We propose a fail safe k metric that can be used in conjunction with visual inspection, and it can be used in-vivo after each additional data point is collected within a phase to determine the optimal point in time to shift between phases (e.g., from baseline to treatment). Preliminary proof of concept data are presented to demonstrate the potential utility of the fail safe k metric with a sample of previously published SCED graphs examining the effects on noncontingent reinforcement on occurrences of problem behavior. Results showed that if the value of fail safe k is equal to or less than the number of sessions in the current phase, then the data path may not be stable and more sessions should be run before changing phases. We discuss the results in terms of using the fail safe k as an additional aid for visual inspection of SCED data.","tags":["Fail safe","Single-case experimental designs","Visual inspection aid"],"title":"Development of an in-vivo metric to aid visual inspection of single-case design data: Do we need to run more sessions?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucy Barnard-Brak","William Y.
