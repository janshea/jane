Even though mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs are two separate constructs, these constructs are likely related and coexisted as a system of beliefs. Constructs of mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs may be interdependent to further contribute to learning motivation, behavior, and outcomes. Only a few studies investigated both mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs together. Guided by previous research studies, this study examined associations of mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs with their predicting factors: motivational variables, the use of learning strategies, and learning outcomes in mathematics among college students. Additionally, I investigated how mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs both as implicit beliefs associated with each other. Finally, to further conceptualize interaction between these implicit beliefs, I examined the existence of profiles of students who are different in mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs.  Consistent results of predictions on motivational variables and self-reported performance revealed the maladaptive feature of a fixed mindset of intelligence; on the other hand, a growth mindset of intelligence failed to be a significant predictor of motivational indicators in general. Meanwhile, a few factors in epistemological beliefs showed weak and unstable predictions on some motivational variables. Even though two subpopulations were identified when examining profiles for mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs, the main distinction between the two subpopulations is from growth and fixed mindset of intelligence. Therefore, the different profiles of students who are different in mindset of intelligence and different in epistemological beliefs are not supported by this data. Discussions related to current findings such as different operationalizations of mindset of intelligence and measures of epistemological beliefs are provided. Implications for future research are also discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Examining college students’ epistemological beliefs and mindset of intelligence and their association with learning motivations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucy Barnard-Brak","Tara Stevens","Zhanxia Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685223765,"objectID":"4180142f0062d8d936ee2861a6719546","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/barnard-brak-predictors-2020/","publishdate":"2023-05-27T21:42:45.149276Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barnard-brak-predictors-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The current study examined 2 sets of variables associated with parents prematurely exiting early intervention services for their child.

We examined three competing models to find relationships between over-claiming, reported familiarity, and mathematics achievement. We then identified latent classes by use of the three variables. This latent class analysis examined the existence of subpopulations, which revealed the disguised details of the relationship between over-claiming, reported familiarity, and mathematics achievement. The results of this study represent findings from a sample of 15-year-olds across the United States (n = 4978). Three distinct latent classes were identified. One latent class demonstrated significantly lower scores on all motivational indicators examined than the other two latent classes, suggesting disengagement in this latent class. Students from the rest two non-disengaged latent classes were considered as engaged students. Results indicate that over-claiming has a significant negative relationship with student achievement in mathematics among the engaged students. The disengaged group appears to over-claim the least. The relationships among these three latent classes provide possible explanations as to why the current literature reported mixed results regarding the relationships between over-claiming and achievement or cognitive ability.","tags":["Achievement","Feeling of knowing","Latent class analysis","Mathematics","Over-claiming"],"title":"Examining the association of over-claiming with mathematics achievement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucy Barnard-Brak","David Richman","Zhanxia Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685223764,"objectID":"b98aa43f568ec786b4be2e5c866dc5a8","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/barnard-brak-age-2019/","publishdate":"2023-05-27T21:42:44.368136Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barnard-brak-age-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong disorder that requires intervention and support services for a growing geriatric population. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mean age at death of individuals with ASD and subsequent comorbidity with Alzheimer’s disease, and any form of dementia, as a whole and according to sex. Design/methodology/approach Data consisted of 1,754 individuals who had an ASD listed as one of the causes of deaths from the National Vital Statistics System with data from 1999 to 2015. In the current study, the authors present contradictory results with a mean age at death for individuals with ASD was 68 years by adjusting for changing prevalence rates. Findings Females with ASD had a higher mean age at death than males with ASD; consistent with the trend in the sex differences in the general population. The results of the current study also indicate that individuals with ASD were, in fact, less likely than the general population to have Alzheimer’s disease or a form of dementia. However, males with ASD were significantly more likely to have acquired Alzheimer’s disease or a form of dementia as compared to females with ASD. Originality/value Guan and Li (2017) reported a mean age at death of 36 years old for individuals with ASD, which was subsequently reported in the mass media, most notably CNN. The authors contend that this study provides a more accurate estimate mean age at death.","tags":["Adults","Autism spectrum disorder","Comorbidity","Death"],"title":"Age at death and comorbidity of dementia-related disorders among individuals with autism spectrum disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"fc745726a34db3a0c6094ffc19ae9295","permalink":"https://example.com/intro-statistics/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/intro-statistics/","section":"","summary":"Intro-Statistics","tags":null,"title":"Intro-Statistics","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://example.com/research/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"My Research","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"How to update this page: https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/\n","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://example.com/teaching/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"This is a summary of my teaching.","tags":null,"title":"My Teaching","type":"page"},{"authors":["Lucy Barnard-Brak","David M.

Although several investigators have disseminated structured criteria and visual inspection aids or strategies, inconsistencies in interpreting graphed data continue to exist even for individuals considered to be experts at interpreting SCED graphs. We propose a fail safe k metric that can be used in conjunction with visual inspection, and it can be used in-vivo after each additional data point is collected within a phase to determine the optimal point in time to shift between phases (e.g., from baseline to treatment). Preliminary proof of concept data are presented to demonstrate the potential utility of the fail safe k metric with a sample of previously published SCED graphs examining the effects on noncontingent reinforcement on occurrences of problem behavior. Results showed that if the value of fail safe k is equal to or less than the number of sessions in the current phase, then the data path may not be stable and more sessions should be run before changing phases. We discuss the results in terms of using the fail safe k as an additional aid for visual inspection of SCED data.","tags":["Fail safe","Single-case experimental designs","Visual inspection aid"],"title":"Development of an in-vivo metric to aid visual inspection of single-case design data: Do we need to run more sessions?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucy Barnard-Brak","William Y.
