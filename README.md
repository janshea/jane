Personal website of Dr. Zhanxia Yang, powered by [Hugo Academic Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic).
When updating Publication list:
    First, generate the .bib file from tools like Zotero (in a folder including all the publications).
    Second, name the bib file as "publications.bib" for running the code below
    Third, upload the .bib file to the "data" section (currently named as 'publications.bib')
    Forth, running the code to covert the .bib file to create the right format for the website (Code: academic import --bibtex data/publications.bib).
    Finally, run 'publish' (the 'publications.bib' need to be deleted to run, so the built-in has the relevant commend to delete it)
