abstract: We examine student performance on mathematics items from the 2012 Program
  for International Student Assessment. Utilizing a 4 parameter logistic Item Response
  Theory model, we were particularly interested in estimating the probability of a
  student who was relatively high achieving incorrectly responding to mathematics
  items as related to having more or less opportunity to learn as rated by the student.
  Results indicate that students who were similarly high achieving yet had less opportunity
  to learn were significantly less likely to correctly respond to an item as compared
  to those who had more opportunity to learn. When accounting for these item-level
  differences in OTL in mathematics, socioeconomic status was longer related to academic
  achievement.
