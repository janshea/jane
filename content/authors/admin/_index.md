* I am an Educational Psychologist specialized in developmental and learning sciences.

* I have received systematic training in research design, statistics, evaluation theory, and educational psychology theories.

* I have been different roles in my profession: a college instructor, a high school teacher, and a researcher.

* I am very interested in data analysis, so I acquired a graduate certificate in Data Science alongside my Ph.D. in Educational Psychology.

* I enjoy being a life-long learner. Also, encouraging others to be a life-long learner brings me the greatest joy.

* In my spare time, I love reading, hiking, and doing exercises.
