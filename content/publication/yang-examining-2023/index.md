abstract: Background and Context Historically, women have been underrepresented in
  computer science. To address this gender gap, researchers advocate for high-quality
  computer science programs for early childhood.Objectives This study examines gender
  differences in coding performance before and after implementing a 24-lesson visual
  programming curriculum using ScratchJr. The curriculum's key features are summarized
  based on teachers' observations of student reactions.Method Using a mixed methods
  approach, the study employs quantitative analysis to assess gender differences in
  pre and post assessments, while qualitative analysis explores the impact of the
  curriculum on girls' and boys' coding performance.Findings The findings reveal comparable
  coding proficiency between boys and girls. Teacher interviews highlight aspects
  of the curriculum that reduced gender stereotypes, such as student engagement, autonomy,
  debugging practice, and collaborative exploration.Implications Policymakers should
  prioritize high-quality computer science programs in early childhood to combat gender-interest
  stereotypes and promote confidence, emotional strengths, perseverance, and collaboration
  through open-ended coding projects.
