abstract: Purpose Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong disorder that requires
  intervention and support services for a growing geriatric population. The purpose
  of this paper is to examine the mean age at death of individuals with ASD and subsequent
  comorbidity with Alzheimer’s disease, and any form of dementia, as a whole and according
  to sex. Design/methodology/approach Data consisted of 1,754 individuals who had
  an ASD listed as one of the causes of deaths from the National Vital Statistics
  System with data from 1999 to 2015. In the current study, the authors present contradictory
  results with a mean age at death for individuals with ASD was 68 years by adjusting
  for changing prevalence rates. Findings Females with ASD had a higher mean age at
  death than males with ASD; consistent with the trend in the sex differences in the
  general population. The results of the current study also indicate that individuals
  with ASD were, in fact, less likely than the general population to have Alzheimer’s
  disease or a form of dementia. However, males with ASD were significantly more likely
  to have acquired Alzheimer’s disease or a form of dementia as compared to females
  with ASD. Originality/value Guan and Li (2017) reported a mean age at death of 36
  years old for individuals with ASD, which was subsequently reported in the mass
  media, most notably CNN. The authors contend that this study provides a more accurate
  estimate mean age at death.
