 abstract = {The current study examined 2 sets of variables associated with parents prematurely exiting early intervention services for their child. The first set consisted of the variables predictive of premature parent withdrawal, and the second set consisted of variables predictive of a parent and child being dismissed from early intervention services because of failure in being able to contact them. This study represents the first empirical examination of variables associated with parents prematurely exiting early intervention services despite having children who continued to qualify for services.},
