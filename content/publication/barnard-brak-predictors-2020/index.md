abstract: The current study examined 2 sets of variables associated with parents prematurely
  exiting early intervention services for their child. The first set consisted of
  the variables predictive of premature parent withdrawal, and the second set consisted
  of variables predictive of a parent and child being dismissed from early intervention
  services because of failure in being able to contact them. This study represents
  the first empirical examination of variables associated with parents prematurely
  exiting early intervention services despite having children who continued to qualify
  for services.
