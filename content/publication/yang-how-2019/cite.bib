 abstract = {This study aims to investigate the impact of information and communication technology (ICT) availability between socioeconomic status (SES) and achievement. We examined the relationship among SES, ICT availability, and achievement as well as how ICT availability mediated the relationship between SES and achievement via structural equation modeling techniques. To examine this relationship, a total of 4978 15-year-old students across the USA were sampled from Program for International Student Assessment 2012. Results indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between SES and achievement, between SES and ICT usage, and between ICT usage and achievement. Additionally, the mediating effect of ICT usage accounts for a great percentage of the total effect of the relationship between SES and achievement. Implications and discussions are provided accordingly.},
