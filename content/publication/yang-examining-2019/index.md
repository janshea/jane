abstract: This study investigated the association of over-claiming with student achievement
  in mathematics from mixture modeling. We examined three competing models to find
  relationships between over-claiming, reported familiarity, and mathematics achievement.
  We then identified latent classes by use of the three variables. This latent class
  analysis examined the existence of subpopulations, which revealed the disguised
  details of the relationship between over-claiming, reported familiarity, and mathematics
  achievement. The results of this study represent findings from a sample of 15-year-olds
  across the United States (n = 4978). Three distinct latent classes were identified.
  One latent class demonstrated significantly lower scores on all motivational indicators
  examined than the other two latent classes, suggesting disengagement in this latent
  class. Students from the rest two non-disengaged latent classes were considered
  as engaged students. Results indicate that over-claiming has a significant negative
  relationship with student achievement in mathematics among the engaged students.
  The disengaged group appears to over-claim the least. The relationships among these
  three latent classes provide possible explanations as to why the current literature
  reported mixed results regarding the relationships between over-claiming and achievement
  or cognitive ability.
