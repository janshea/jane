abstract: Comparing visual inspection results of graphed data reveals inconsistencies
  in the interpretation of the same graph among single-case experimental design (SCED)
  researchers and practitioners. Although several investigators have disseminated
  structured criteria and visual inspection aids or strategies, inconsistencies in
  interpreting graphed data continue to exist even for individuals considered to be
  experts at interpreting SCED graphs. We propose a fail safe k metric that can be
  used in conjunction with visual inspection, and it can be used in-vivo after each
  additional data point is collected within a phase to determine the optimal point
  in time to shift between phases (e.g., from baseline to treatment). Preliminary
  proof of concept data are presented to demonstrate the potential utility of the
  fail safe k metric with a sample of previously published SCED graphs examining the
  effects on noncontingent reinforcement on occurrences of problem behavior. Results
  showed that if the value of fail safe k is equal to or less than the number of sessions
  in the current phase, then the data path may not be stable and more sessions should
  be run before changing phases. We discuss the results in terms of using the fail
  safe k as an additional aid for visual inspection of SCED data.
