abstract: An F2 population of 224 individuals derived from a bacterial blight resistant
  cotton line S295 (Gossypium hirsutum L.) carrying the B12 resistance gene, and a
  susceptible line, Pima S7 (G. barbadense L.), was inoculated with Xanthomonas axonopodis
  pv. malvacearum (Xam) Race 18, causal agent of bacterial blight, to survey their
  resistance or susceptibility. The phenotype segregation in the F2 population indicated
  that the bacterial blight resistance gene, B12, is a single dominant gene. Simple
  sequence repeats (SSR) markers were used to survey the linkage to the B12 resistance
  gene. Two SSR markers, CIR246 and JESPR156 on Chromosome 14, were found closely
  linked to B12 with a genetic distance of 0.9cM and 6.17cM, respectively. Comparisons
  of genetic and physical maps were used to delineate the location of the B12 locus
  to a region of 941 kb.
