abstract: 'In the past educational research studies, many studies investigated mindset
  of intelligence and epistemological beliefs and reported significant effects on
  students’ motivation. Even though mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs
  are two separate constructs, these constructs are likely related and coexisted as
  a system of beliefs. Constructs of mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs
  may be interdependent to further contribute to learning motivation, behavior, and
  outcomes. Only a few studies investigated both mindset of intelligence and epistemological
  beliefs together. Guided by previous research studies, this study examined associations
  of mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs with their predicting factors:
  motivational variables, the use of learning strategies, and learning outcomes in
  mathematics among college students. Additionally, I investigated how mindset of
  intelligence and epistemological beliefs both as implicit beliefs associated with
  each other. Finally, to further conceptualize interaction between these implicit
  beliefs, I examined the existence of profiles of students who are different in mindset
  of intelligence and epistemological beliefs.  Consistent results of predictions
  on motivational variables and self-reported performance revealed the maladaptive
  feature of a fixed mindset of intelligence; on the other hand, a growth mindset
  of intelligence failed to be a significant predictor of motivational indicators
  in general. Meanwhile, a few factors in epistemological beliefs showed weak and
  unstable predictions on some motivational variables. Even though two subpopulations
  were identified when examining profiles for mindset of intelligence and epistemological
  beliefs, the main distinction between the two subpopulations is from growth and
  fixed mindset of intelligence. Therefore, the different profiles of students who
  are different in mindset of intelligence and different in epistemological beliefs
  are not supported by this data. Discussions related to current findings such as
  different operationalizations of mindset of intelligence and measures of epistemological
  beliefs are provided. Implications for future research are also discussed.'
