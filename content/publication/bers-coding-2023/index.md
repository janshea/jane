abstract: "This paper describes the iterative research and evaluation of the Coding\
  \ as Another Language (CAL) curriculum that utilizes the free ScratchJr programming\
  \ language in kindergarten to second grade. CAL was designed using principles of\
  \ three theoretical frameworks: Curriculum Research Framework (CRF), which proposes\
  \ different phases in the creation of research-based curriculum; Constructionism,\
  \ which presents a computationally-rich project-based methodology based on identifying\
  \ powerful ideas from a learning domain; and Positive Technological Development,\
  \ which intentionally integrates socio-emotional and ethical dimensions into curricular\
  \ experiences. The pedagogical foundation of CAL involves the understanding of coding\
  \ as a literacy, that is, putting developmentally-appropriate powerful ideas of\
  \ computer science in conversation with those taught in language arts. The paper\
  \ first describes CAL and then presents results from both a pilot study and a cluster\
  \ randomized controlled trial that set to evaluate CAL's feasibility and impact\
  \ on studentsâ€™ learning outcomes. Our findings showed that the CAL curriculum was\
  \ not only feasible to implement, but also effective for improving coding skills.\
  \ However, CAL's impact on computational thinking is less clear given that in the\
  \ cluster randomized controlled trial, both the control and the intervention groups\
  \ improved equally on a measure of computational thinking."
