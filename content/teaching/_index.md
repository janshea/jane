## Welcome
Welcome to the _My Teaching_ page!

Here is a template for my **teaching** page. I will be sharing **important** notes here.

- Bullet 1: human brain üß† is fascinating. 
- Bullet 2: In this page, I can include audio, video, images, math, code, [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) diagrams, and [much more](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/)
- Bullet 3: I can edit my notes online in GitHub, or any Git-connected Markdown app such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://vscode.dev/)

```markmap {height="400px"}
- Second Brain
  - **powerful** knowledge base
  - **easy**: just plain text Markdown files
  - all your thoughts are **connected**
  - highly **extensible**
    - add more **content types**
      - add more **shortcodes**
    - add more **features**
  - **future-proof** & open source ‚ù§Ô∏è
    - **Markdown** files
```

## Public vs Private Second Brain

Choose between **publishing and sharing your knowledge online or creating a private second brain**.

To create an **open second brain**, share your knowledge with others [by deploying this template](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/) as a public website.

To create a **private second brain** either:

- After deploying your site above, [password protect your online second brain](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/password-protection/) and configure your GitHub repo as **private**
- [Download this template](https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-second-brain-theme) and [run the tool locally](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install-hugo-extended/)
