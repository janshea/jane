	abstract = {We examine student performance on mathematics items from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment. Utilizing a 4 parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we were particularly interested in estimating the probability of a student who was relatively high achieving incorrectly responding to mathematics items as related to having more or less opportunity to learn as rated by the student. Results indicate that students who were similarly high achieving yet had less opportunity to learn were significantly less likely to correctly respond to an item as compared to those who had more opportunity to learn. When accounting for these item-level differences in OTL in mathematics, socioeconomic status was longer related to academic achievement.},

	abstract = {Comparing visual inspection results of graphed data reveals inconsistencies in the interpretation of the same graph among single-case experimental design (SCED) researchers and practitioners. Although several investigators have disseminated structured criteria and visual inspection aids or strategies, inconsistencies in interpreting graphed data continue to exist even for individuals considered to be experts at interpreting SCED graphs. We propose a fail safe k metric that can be used in conjunction with visual inspection, and it can be used in-vivo after each additional data point is collected within a phase to determine the optimal point in time to shift between phases (e.g., from baseline to treatment). Preliminary proof of concept data are presented to demonstrate the potential utility of the fail safe k metric with a sample of previously published SCED graphs examining the effects on noncontingent reinforcement on occurrences of problem behavior. Results showed that if the value of fail safe k is equal to or less than the number of sessions in the current phase, then the data path may not be stable and more sessions should be run before changing phases. We discuss the results in terms of using the fail safe k as an additional aid for visual inspection of SCED data.},

We examined the relationship among SES, ICT availability, and achievement as well as how ICT availability mediated the relationship between SES and achievement via structural equation modeling techniques. To examine this relationship, a total of 4978 15-year-old students across the USA were sampled from Program for International Student Assessment 2012. Results indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between SES and achievement, between SES and ICT usage, and between ICT usage and achievement. Additionally, the mediating effect of ICT usage accounts for a great percentage of the total effect of the relationship between SES and achievement. Implications and discussions are provided accordingly.},

	abstract = {Purpose Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong disorder that requires intervention and support services for a growing geriatric population. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mean age at death of individuals with ASD and subsequent comorbidity with Alzheimer’s disease, and any form of dementia, as a whole and according to sex. Design/methodology/approach Data consisted of 1,754 individuals who had an ASD listed as one of the causes of deaths from the National Vital Statistics System with data from 1999 to 2015. In the current study, the authors present contradictory results with a mean age at death for individuals with ASD was 68 years by adjusting for changing prevalence rates. Findings Females with ASD had a higher mean age at death than males with ASD; consistent with the trend in the sex differences in the general population. The results of the current study also indicate that individuals with ASD were, in fact, less likely than the general population to have Alzheimer’s disease or a form of dementia. However, males with ASD were significantly more likely to have acquired Alzheimer’s disease or a form of dementia as compared to females with ASD. Originality/value Guan and Li (2017) reported a mean age at death of 36 years old for individuals with ASD, which was subsequently reported in the mass media, most notably CNN. The authors contend that this study provides a more accurate estimate mean age at death.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the association of over-claiming with student achievement in mathematics from mixture modeling. We examined three competing models to find relationships between over-claiming, reported familiarity, and mathematics achievement. We then identified latent classes by use of the three variables. This latent class analysis examined the existence of subpopulations, which revealed the disguised details of the relationship between over-claiming, reported familiarity, and mathematics achievement. The results of this study represent findings from a sample of 15-year-olds across the United States (n = 4978). Three distinct latent classes were identified. One latent class demonstrated significantly lower scores on all motivational indicators examined than the other two latent classes, suggesting disengagement in this latent class. Students from the rest two non-disengaged latent classes were considered as engaged students. Results indicate that over-claiming has a significant negative relationship with student achievement in mathematics among the engaged students. The disengaged group appears to over-claim the least. The relationships among these three latent classes provide possible explanations as to why the current literature reported mixed results regarding the relationships between over-claiming and achievement or cognitive ability.},

	abstract = {An F2 population of 224 individuals derived from a bacterial blight resistant cotton line S295 (Gossypium hirsutum L.) carrying the B12 resistance gene, and a susceptible line, Pima S7 (G. barbadense L.), was inoculated with Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. malvacearum (Xam) Race 18, causal agent of bacterial blight, to survey their resistance or susceptibility. The phenotype segregation in the F2 population indicated that the bacterial blight resistance gene, B12, is a single dominant gene. Simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers were used to survey the linkage to the B12 resistance gene. Two SSR markers, CIR246 and JESPR156 on Chromosome 14, were found closely linked to B12 with a genetic distance of 0.9cM and 6.17cM, respectively. Comparisons of genetic and physical maps were used to delineate the location of the B12 locus to a region of 941 kb.},

	copyright = {Unrestricted.},
	url = {https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/handle/2346/86722},
	abstract = {In the past educational research studies, many studies investigated mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs and reported significant effects on students’ motivation. Even though mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs are two separate constructs, these constructs are likely related and coexisted as a system of beliefs. Constructs of mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs may be interdependent to further contribute to learning motivation, behavior, and outcomes. Only a few studies investigated both mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs together. Guided by previous research studies, this study examined associations of mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs with their predicting factors: motivational variables, the use of learning strategies, and learning outcomes in mathematics among college students. Additionally, I investigated how mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs both as implicit beliefs associated with each other. Finally, to further conceptualize interaction between these implicit beliefs, I examined the existence of profiles of students who are different in mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs. 
Consistent results of predictions on motivational variables and self-reported performance revealed the maladaptive feature of a fixed mindset of intelligence; on the other hand, a growth mindset of intelligence failed to be a significant predictor of motivational indicators in general. Meanwhile, a few factors in epistemological beliefs showed weak and unstable predictions on some motivational variables. Even though two subpopulations were identified when examining profiles for mindset of intelligence and epistemological beliefs, the main distinction between the two subpopulations is from growth and fixed mindset of intelligence. Therefore, the different profiles of students who are different in mindset of intelligence and different in epistemological beliefs are not supported by this data. Discussions related to current findings such as different operationalizations of mindset of intelligence and measures of epistemological beliefs are provided. Implications for future research are also discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the iterative research and evaluation of the Coding as Another Language (CAL) curriculum that utilizes the free ScratchJr programming language in kindergarten to second grade. CAL was designed using principles of three theoretical frameworks: Curriculum Research Framework (CRF), which proposes different phases in the creation of research-based curriculum; Constructionism, which presents a computationally-rich project-based methodology based on identifying powerful ideas from a learning domain; and Positive Technological Development, which intentionally integrates socio-emotional and ethical dimensions into curricular experiences. The pedagogical foundation of CAL involves the understanding of coding as a literacy, that is, putting developmentally-appropriate powerful ideas of computer science in conversation with those taught in language arts. The paper first describes CAL and then presents results from both a pilot study and a cluster randomized controlled trial that set to evaluate CAL's feasibility and impact on students’ learning outcomes. Our findings showed that the CAL curriculum was not only feasible to implement, but also effective for improving coding skills. However, CAL's impact on computational thinking is less clear given that in the cluster randomized controlled trial, both the control and the intervention groups improved equally on a measure of computational thinking.},
